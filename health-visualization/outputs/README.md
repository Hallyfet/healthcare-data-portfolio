The sample data was created with 100 patient records
A visualization showing the relationship between the length of stay and readmission status 
The model performance metrics show:
For the real data: 50% accuracy
For the test data: 35% accuracy with detailed classification metrics
This lower accuracy is expected since we're using random sample data. With real hospital data, the model would likely perform better due to actual patterns in the data.# Outputs
